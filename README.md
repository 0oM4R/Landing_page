# Usage 

### Project Summary
This project aims to give you real-world scenarios of manipulating the DOM. The functionality you will be using serves two purposes: to prepare you for appending dynamically added data to the DOM, and to show you how javascript can improve the usability of an otherwise static site. This project barely touches the surface of what is possible, but it does use some incredibly common events, methods, and logic.

### Waht this project do ? 
> to make it more clear there is main behaior points I'll explain here :
>> #### Navigation
>> - Navigation is built dynamically as an unordered list. Start with empty ul and dynamically build navigation using Append, appendChild, and innerHTML.
>> #### Section Active State
>> It should be clear which section is being viewed while scrolling through the page.
>>> - Tip: Detect the element location relative to the viewport using .getBoundingClientRect() built-in function.
>> #### Scroll to Anchor
>> - When clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link should scroll to the appropriate section.
>> - You can use the following methods to fulfill this criterion:
>> - Use addEventListener('click',....) to listen to the click event.
>> - Use preventDefault() as if there is a default event occurring we need to stop that.
>> - There are several javascript methods for scrolling, scroll(), scrollBy(), and scrollIntoView() are all >> acceptable.
>> - A smooth scrolling behavior is expected in the project.
